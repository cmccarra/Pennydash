Verifying fallback behavior with simulation enabled:

✅ SUCCESS: OpenAI individual fallback is working properly!
All individual transactions were categorized using the Bayes classifier, as expected with simulated failures.

✅ SUCCESS: OpenAI batch fallback is working properly!
All batch transactions were categorized using the Bayes classifier, as expected with simulated failures.
