🧠 Fundamental UX Design Principles to Apply
Progressive Disclosure: Don’t overwhelm the user — show only what they need, when they need it.

Affordance & Feedback: Clear buttons, status indicators, inline validation.

Recognition Over Recall: Users should recognize what to do, not remember.

Minimal Friction: Reduce unnecessary clicks or forms.

Hierarchy & Focus: Visually guide the user’s flow.

🧩 Optimal Landing Page (App Entry Point) Structure
This is the first screen they see after logging in or arriving (not marketing site):

🔷 1. Welcome + Onboarding Guidance (optional for first-time users)
Show this only once or if no transactions exist.

Content:

Friendly welcome message ("Let's get started with your budget")

Step-by-step indicators (horizontal or vertical):

Upload Statements

Review Transactions

Categorize

Generate Reports

✅ This sets the mental model.

🔷 2. Primary Action Area: Upload Statements
If no transactions exist yet, this is the focus.

UI Elements:

Drag & drop zone (with icons for PDF/CSV/XML)

Or file picker

Dropdown: Select Account or Bank (optional)

Submit button → parses on upload

🔷 3. Secondary Option: Sample Data
If they just want to play around.

UI Elements:

Button: “Try with Sample Data”

Useful for first-time users with no files on hand

🔷 4. Recent Uploads or Upload History (optional)
Useful once they’ve started using the app

UI Elements:

Table or card view of:

Upload date

File name

of transactions parsed
Status: Parsed / Needs Review / Categorized

Clicking one would deep-link into the tagging view.

🔷 5. Tagging Progress Overview
Once they have data, show progress bar:

"You’ve tagged 150 of 432 transactions"

CTA: “Continue Tagging”

🔷 6. Access Reports (Once Data Exists)
Becomes a secondary action if there’s data

UI Elements:

Button: “View Reports”

Mini chart previews (optional)

🧭 Suggested Flow Logic
App State	What to Show
No uploads yet	Welcome + Upload Area + Sample Data
Uploads exist, no tags	Uploads List + Start Tagging
Transactions tagged	Show Tagging Progress + Reports CTA
Fully tagged	Emphasize Reports UI
🎨 Visual Layout Recommendation
Responsive 2-Column Grid:

Left Column	Right Column
Onboarding steps, tagging progress, recent uploads	Upload box, sample data CTA, reports preview
Use card components, progress indicators, and modals for file uploads or tagging walkthroughs.
