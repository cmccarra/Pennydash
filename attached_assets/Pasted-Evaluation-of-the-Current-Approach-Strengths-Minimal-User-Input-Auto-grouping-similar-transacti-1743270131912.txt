Evaluation of the Current Approach:

Strengths:

Minimal User Input: Auto-grouping similar transactions and pre-filling categories reduces manual effort.

Flexibility: Users can approve whole batches or fine-tune by editing or removing outliers.

Scalability: By grouping transactions, users aren’t forced to review each individual transaction.

Clarity: Clearly delineating file-level account data before processing ensures accurate ledger logic (e.g., reversing debits/credits for credit card files).

Potential Drawbacks:

Over-reliance on AI: If the AI grouping or category suggestions are off, users might need to make many manual corrections, potentially reducing the benefit of automation.

User Overwhelm: Even with batching, a large number of batches could overwhelm a user if the interface isn’t carefully designed.

Feedback Loop: There may be missed opportunities to use user corrections to continually improve AI suggestions.

Alternative Approaches & Recommendations:

Confidence Thresholds & Active Learning:

AI Confidence: Incorporate confidence scores on the suggested categorization. Only prompt the user for review when confidence is below a set threshold.

Active Learning: Use user corrections as feedback to refine future predictions, reducing manual input over time.

Inline, Contextual Editing:

Rather than a separate review step for each batch, allow inline editing directly on the transaction list where possible. This “on-the-fly” correction can streamline the experience.

Review Queue for Outliers:

Instead of automatically placing removed transactions into a generic “uncategorized” bucket, create a dynamic “review queue” that highlights transactions with low-confidence categorization. This helps focus user attention where it’s most needed.

Progressive Disclosure:

For users with large data sets, consider collapsing batches by default and expanding only those that the AI flags as uncertain or that the user has not yet reviewed. This keeps the interface clean and minimizes cognitive load.

Customizable Workflow Settings:

Allow users to set preferences in the settings. For example, they might choose a “minimal intervention” mode where only low-confidence batches are shown for review, or a “detailed review” mode for those who want to verify everything.
