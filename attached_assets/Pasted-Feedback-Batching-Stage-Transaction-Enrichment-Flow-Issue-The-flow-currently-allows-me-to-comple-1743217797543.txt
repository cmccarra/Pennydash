Feedback: Batching Stage – Transaction Enrichment Flow
Issue:
The flow currently allows me to complete:

Step 1: Upload Transactions

Step 2: Account Setup — selecting Account Source and Account Type

However, during Step 3: Processing Transactions (Batching Stage), the system hangs and does not proceed.

Clarification: What the Batching Step Is Supposed to Do
Purpose of Batching:
This step should analyze all uploaded transactions and group them into batches based on similarity of description and/or merchant name.

The goal is to:

Present batches of similar transactions to the user

Pre-fill category, tags, and merchant where possible using AI or existing heuristics

Allow the user to approve, edit, or reject the batch's metadata

How Batching Should Be Executed:
AI or similarity logic should:

Normalize and clean the description fields

Use fuzzy matching or embeddings (if using an AI API) to identify clusters of similar transactions

Assign proposed enrichment values (category, tags, merchant) to each batch

The user interface should:

Display a preview of a few transactions from each batch

Provide options to:

✅ Approve the entire batch

✏️ Manually edit attributes (category, tags, merchant)

❌ Decline the batch and leave those transactions untagged

Suggestion: AI Subscription Key
If the batching logic is relying on an AI API (e.g., OpenAI, Cohere, or similar), make sure:

An API key is properly connected

There is fallback logic if the API fails or times out

The system can at least attempt a basic similarity match (e.g., string distance) to form batches if AI fails

Required Fixes:
Please review the instructions and re-verify the logic for Step 3 – Batching Stage:

Ensure the system is not hanging due to an unhandled promise or missing API key

Confirm that the backend or parsing service is returning batches before rendering the UI

Add a loading state or progress indicator so the user knows if analysis is still running

User Experience Note:
This step is critical for scaling categorization.

The user must have a smooth, intuitive experience to:

Understand the batch

Confirm or correct the data
