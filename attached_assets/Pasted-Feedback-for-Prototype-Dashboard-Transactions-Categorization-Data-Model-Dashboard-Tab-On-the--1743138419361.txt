Feedback for Prototype – Dashboard, Transactions, Categorization & Data Model
Dashboard Tab:
On the bottom row of cards (Spending vs Income, Top Category, Spending Trend, Budget Status):

If the user is new and has no transactions, this row should remain hidden.

If the user has transactions, this row should be visible and displayed at the top, above the “Upload Transactions” row.

These cards should reflect actual data pulled from the transactions table once it’s populated.

Transactions Tab:
The search bar is missing a search icon — please add this.

The spacing between the icon and the search input is misaligned — please correct this to ensure proper visual spacing.

Filters:

Filters are functional, but when clicking to open them and clicking again, they don’t close — this should be fixed (toggle behavior).

We should also be able to filter by category — please add this filter option.

The "Categorize" button currently does not perform any action — this needs to be connected to its intended flow.

Data Model:
The uploaded transaction file was from a credit card statement, and in that case:

Debits and credits are reversed compared to a bank account (e.g. a purchase is a negative in bank accounts but a positive in credit cards).

The system currently misinterprets this, which causes Income vs Expense calculations to be flipped.

We need to:

Add a field to the transaction model that reflects the source of the transaction (e.g. credit card, bank account, etc.).

The user should be able to define/manage these sources in the settings.

The AI should be able to automatically determine the source based on the uploaded document (e.g. based on institution, account number, or known credit card pattern).

Based on the source, the system should determine the correct interpretation of transaction values (positive or negative).

Categorization Model:
Please build support for a hierarchy within categorization:

A top-level category (e.g. “Food”)

One or more subcategories (e.g. “Groceries”, “Restaurants”)

One or more tags (e.g. “Whole Foods”, “Uber Eats”)

Design should consider these as pills in separate rows:

Top row: categories

Middle row: subcategories

Bottom row: tags

Side Note: Please evaluate whether this is the most user-friendly and scalable way to structure categorization. Open to better options if they exist.

Gamified Categorization Flow (New Feature Request):
Create a categorization page with the following interactive flow:

Show one transaction at a time that has no category.

Show AI’s best guess for category/subcategory/tags.

User can:

Click ✔️ (checkmark) to confirm

Click ❌ (X) to reject

Or manually select the correct category/subcategory/tags

Once categorized:

AI should automatically reprocess all remaining uncategorized transactions.

If there are similar transactions, they should be auto-categorized based on the user’s last action.

This should reduce manual effort and speed up the categorization workflow.
